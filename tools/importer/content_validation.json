As Reserve collection items are by nature in high demand, they are subject to shorter lending periods and higher penalties for late return. Reserve collection loan periods are 1 day and are not automatically renewed. They must be returned to the campus library from which they were borrowed by the end of the initial borrowing period. Only two Reserve collection items can be borrowed at any time. Print Journal Articles Western students and staff may request copies of articles held in print journals, and held only at a campus library other than your home library. These articles are scanned and emailed to your Western email account.

Be sure to include the journal title, volume/issue number, year of publication, article title and author and the page numbers if available Please allow two working days for delivery of item via your Western email. How To Use The Library Getting Started The Library has a wide range of resources available for loan. You will require a Library card to loan physical resources at the campus libraries. For Western students and staff , your ID card is your Library card. For Alumni Members, your GradLife card is your Library card. For all other membership types, the library will provide a Library card at the time of joining. Familiarise yourself with the loan conditions . Library items may be borrowed from and returned to any of the campus libraries . Return chutes are located within or near each library entrance. Wherever possible, items should be borrowed and returned using the Self-Service Machine located within the campus library. You are responsible for all transactions on your record in the Library system. Lost cards should be reported to the Library to ensure no unauthorised use. You are responsible for the timely return of borrowed items irrespective of the receipt or non-receipt of email notices. Please see Managing Your Loans and Requests for further information. Requesting & Intercampus Delivery If the item you need is unavailable at your \"home\" library, you may visit the campus library which has a copy available and borrow the item. Alternatively, you may request an item to be delivered via the Intercampus Delivery service for pick up at a nominated campus library. There is no charge for this service. Note : the courier service is not available to or from Sydney City Campus. Most items are available for Intercampus delivery, with the following exceptions: Reserve Collection material Not for loan materials Special collections Items may be requested via the Library Search Box 'Request' link.

This panel will explore how local action can drive broader systems change, build post-election climate momentum, and revalue care-based practices as legitimate climate strategies. Panellists: Dr Jenna Condie \u2013 Western Sydney University / Blue Mountains Parents for Climate Rob Morrison, Blue Mountains City Council representative \u2013 Local government climate & reuse strategy Nic Seton, CEO Parents for Climate \u2013 Community-based climate action Student activist \u2013 WSU Clothes swap organiser (tbc) (Chair/MC): A/Prof Stephen Healy, Western Sydney University Guiding questions: What is your current project and how does it connect reuse/repair with climate justice? How can researchers, councils, and communities collaborate to extend impact? What does an effective post-election climate politics look like from the ground up? How can reuse and repair practices be recognised as legitimate and measurable forms of climate action? Come along to be inspired, challenged, and connected.

How Autobiography Helps Health Professionals Understand Women\u2019s Experience of Postpartum Psychosis Dr Diana Jefferies is a senior lecturer in the School of Nursing and Midwifery at Western Sydney University. She has a clinical background in mental health and HIV/AIDS nursing and an academic background in the humanities. It is this interdisciplinary combination of knowledge that has sparked her interest in exploring how women make meaning of their mental distress after childbirth, their access to healthcare, their response to treatment, and any strategies they may use to promote recovery. One method of accessing how women make meaning of their experience of postpartum mental distress is through published autobiography. As this is the woman\u2019s writing, unmediated by the health professional\u2019s lens, their thoughts about their illness become a pure distillation of their experience. This experience can then be read against current clinical knowledge and guidelines to identify if gaps in services exist and could be improved from these personal accounts. Dr Jefferies will discuss three autobiographies of women\u2019s accounts of postpartum psychosis, which occurs in 1-2 women in 1000 in the first four to six weeks following childbirth. This condition is a frightening and traumatic experience for the woman as she experiences rapid mood swings, hallucinations, delusions and confused thinking. Many women are reluctant to disclose their symptoms as they worry about losing custody of their child. Even though women may recognise there is something wrong, they may not receive treatment until the illness has become very severe. These autobiographies are: The Book of Margery Kempe (c.1400), Oxford University Press (2015) Thomas Walsh, Amanda (2022): A Mother\u2019s Mind: A Story of Postnatal Psychosis, Anxiety and Depression, Green Olive Press. Beetson, Ariane (2024): Because I\u2019m Not Myself: A Memoir of Motherhood, Madness and Coming Back from the Brink, Black Inc. Reading about women\u2019s experience of postnatal psychosis from the early 15 th century to the present demonstrates a long view of an illness that remains constant. It is from this perspective that it can be read against current clinical guidelines to ensure that women have optimum health accounts.

Reducing Inequalities through Financial Literacy - Associate Professor Michelle Cull When Associate Professor Michelle Cull began teaching a course at Western Sydney University on financial planning, she noticed that although students had a strong interest in basic personal finance, they lacked knowledge. \"It was a surprise to see how little students understood basic personal finance, even when they were enrolled in an advanced business-related subject,\" says Cull. \"I\u2019ve seen high-achieving students let their grades slip, or not submit assignments on time. Often it would come back to a financial situation affecting their sleep and mental well-being.\" To bridge the gap, she considered creating a tool that offers students advice before they make financial decisions. Assisted by Professor Catherine Attard in the School of Education, she partnered with UniBank \u2014 a bank focused on serving the university sector \u2014 and a developer from Western\u2019s Launch Pad startup incubator, to design a personal finance app specifically for university students in Australia, called Wallet$mart. The app includes features and resources covering seven crucial areas for student life: borrowing, budgeting, buying a car, education fees, employment, moving out of home, and saving. When they sign up, students are tested on their knowledge of personal finance. This generates a 'Wallet$mart score' that students are encouraged to improve upon as they learn from in-app resources. In a survey conducted after five months of app use, Cull found that 75% of the students using it felt it had positively influenced their financial knowledge and money management habits. Students who used all features of the app answered 81% more accurately on questions commonly used to test basic financial literacy than students who weren\u2019t using the app. From: 1:00pm Wednesday, October 22, 2025 To: 2:00pm Wednesday, October 22, 2025 Location: Parramatta City Campus Campus: Parramatta City Audiences: Academics & researchers, General Interest, Post-graduate students, Undergraduate Students Categories: Community Events, Thought Leadership Events Registration: Registration is required for this event. A Storybook of Culling - Associate Professor David R. Cole The year is 2095, the devastating effects of climate change persist despite global efforts to mitigate their impact. Set in the Persianized city of Sal\u2019lad, this tale explores the collision of two disparate narrative within the same tumultuous backdrop. An academic finds himself ensnared in a perilous liaison with a captivating Persian woman, while behind the scenes, a clandestine society orchestrates what they believe to be the greatest act in human history. As the twenty-first century lurches from crisis to crisis, humanity remains mired in unresolved turmoil. Unbeknownst to the world, a secret society devises a solution to the planet\u2019s woes. Yet, their plans are shrouded in mystery, guarded by the threat of death for any who dare to speak of them. Navigating the treacherous landscape of impending catastrophe and lost love, only the innocence of a child-like consciousness may comprehend the precipice navigate the precipice of these singularly horrific acts. This is a Storybook of Culling \u2013 a tale of heartbreak and the chilling rationalization of acts too unspeakable to fathom. David R. Cole is an Associate Professor in Education and Cultural Analysis at Western Sydney University. He has lived in Egypt, South America and Australia. In the 1990s, he was at the University of Warwick, UK, and studied theory-fiction alongside the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU). He has previously published two works in this genre, A Mushroom of Glass and The Nook in the Stream. He has been working in teacher education in Australia since 2004, and during that time has published 18 academic books that have helped to define the knowledge field of Deleuze and Education. He believes that creativity and imaginative thought are under threat in contemporary society, and their renewal is the key to humanity\u2019s future survival.

Her research focus is an exploration of the ways in which minorities are morally, politically and culturally marginalised in legal, institutional, and broader community arenas. Dr Dagistanli engages with the intersectional suffering of women of colour whose experiences are tied together by a common thread; the racial and epistemic injuries sustained through institutional responses which compound the gender violence already endured. In the spectrum from silence and erasure to culturally inapt standards of wellbeing and self-care, Dr Dagistanli explores how responses to violence against women of colour can be morally and ethically lacking. Tracing the common thread of insult and injury through gender violence cases within diaspora communities in Australia, to the violence suffered by women in war zones abroad, institutions need to aspire to standards that move beyond the well-trodden path of 'white benevolence', towards listening, hearing and foregrounding the voices of women in those cultural communities. Understanding Diabetes & Pasifika Community Research: Freya MacMillan & Afioga Sal\u0101 Ronda Thompson Australia has a significant number of immigrants from the Pacific Islands. According to the 2016 census, 75,755 people are of Samoan heritage and more than 40% of them live in New South Wales. Samoans have an inherited predisposition to diabetes, but prior to the Western study, there was little research on the effectiveness of public health interventions to reduce the health risks of diabetes in this immigrant group. Professor Freya MacMillan and Distinguished Professor David Simmons' team developed a program called Le Taeao Afua (the new dawn) derived from evidence-based research on community interventions and tailored by participants themselves to fit the Australian-Samoan lifestyle. The University worked with Samoan community activator, Afioga Sal\u0101 Ronda Thompson who turn trained 20 volunteers to become peer support facilitators. After 3-8 months, the participants had statistically significant reductions in HbA1c levels, average blood sugar for the past two to three months, a significant health improvement outcome. At this event, Professor MacMillan and Afioga Sal\u0101 Ronda Thompson discussed the research, community engagement and co-creation that led to the success of the NHMRC-funded Pasifika Preventing Diabetes Program (PPDP).

The Impact of Menstrual Health Across the Lifespan - Associate Professor Mike Armour, Professor Tania Ferfolja and Dr Michelle O'Shea Menstrual and gynaecological health conditions, such as period pain, are incredibly common, affecting around 9 in 10 under the age of 25, while endometriosis is about as common as diabetes, and most women will experience perimenopausal symptoms. Despite this there has been limited research and support for women, girls, and those who menstruate, leading to significant impacts at school, higher education and work. This event will explore how these conditions impact people across the lifespan and what can be done to help reduce these impacts to help ensure gender equity across many the different spheres of life. About the presenters: Associate Professor Mike Armour is an Associate Professor in Reproductive Health, at NICM Health Research Institute, Western Sydney University.

This presentation was recorded, and is available to watch . White Nose Syndrome vs Australian Bats - Dr Nicholas Wu and Mr Tom\u00e1s Villada-Cadavid\u200b White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a devastating wildlife disease that has killed millions of insectivorous bats in North America since 2006, when the causal fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans ( Pd ) was first detected. Australian bats might soon face exposure to this potentially catastrophic fungal disease. Limited initial screening indicates the fungus is not currently in Australia. However, a Commonwealth-initiated expert risk assessment has concluded it is \u2018almost certain\u2019 that Pd will be inadvertently introduced into an Australian cave within the next ten years. Dr Nicholas Wu and Mr Tom\u00e1s Villada-Cadavid\u200b discuss their research which aims to understand, prepare for, and respond to the imminent threat posed by WNS to Australia\u2019s bat fauna. Learn what you can do to also protect Australian bats, and how to respond if you come across a potentially infected animal. Manufacturing and Recycling for a Circular Economy - Professor Richard Yang Professor Richard Yang is the Director, Centre for Advanced Manufacturing Technology (CfAMT), the Research Theme Leader, Industrialisation and Materials (IAM), and the Discipline Leader, Mechanical, Mechatronic and Robotics (MMR), School of Engineering, Design and Built Environment (SoEDBE), Western Sydney University. Prof Yang is an internationally recognised research leader on fields of research including Advanced Manufacturing, Additive Manufacturing (3D printing) of metals, polymers and composites, Advanced Engineering Materials & Structures, Circular Manufacturing & Circular Economy, Defence Technology, Industry 4.0, Machine Condition Monitoring (MCM) & Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), Metal Forming, Metal Surface Treatment, etc. He has been awarded over $12m in competitive research grants, including 12 ARC grants (1 ARC Training Centre, 2 DPs, 3 LPs, and 6 LIEFs), 2 CSIRO/NSF Convergence Accelerator on recycled thermoplastic and composites as well as more than 20 from government and/or industry. He has published approximately 300 high-quality technical articles in top scientific journals, books, and conferences as a major contributor in his relevant fields of research including Mechanical, Mechatronic, Manufacturing, Materials, Aerospace, Civil and Defence engineering. Every year, global plastic manufacturing has reached a volume of 400 million metric tons. Consequently, there exists a significant imperative to minimise the environmental impacts of plastics and the associated manufacturing procedures. Plastic recycling is a pressing global environmental issue, with a staggering 7.8 billion metric tons of plastic produced since 1950. Approximately 55% of the plastic waste was disposed of in landfills, approximately 30% is presently in use, about 8% has been utilised for energy recovery through incineration, and a mere 7% has undergone recycling for a secondary purpose. The issue of plastic pollution emerges as a global challenge that transcends boundaries, prompting numerous countries worldwide to commit to enhancing their local plastic recycling rates. Under the concept of circularity, in recent years, the emergence of advanced manufacturing technologies, such as additive manufacturing (AM) offers a promising solution. In this project, we experimentally and numerically investigated the feasibility of common recycled thermoplastic materials, including recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) and glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate (rPETG) thermoplastics using the fused granular fabrication (FGF) 3D printing technique. Masculinity, Backlash and Antifeminism - Dr Lucy Nicholas How can we understand the resurgence of masculinism in Australia and elsewhere? How can we challenge antifeminism and the increase in misogyny? Dr Lucy Nicholas discusses the changes in contemporary masculinity and the worrying public resurgence of reactionary misogyny, especially online, and how we can use academic ideas to make sense of them. They will consider the emotional and ideological drivers of these ideas, some of the impacts they have, and how they may be challenged. With a diverse academic background, Dr Nicholas received their PhD from the University of Edinburgh before embarking on a career that has taken them from the University of Portsmouth to their current position in Australia. Throughout their journey, they have demonstrated a passion for teaching, covering a wide range of subjects including sociology, social and political theory, gender and sexualities, and academic skills. Dr Nicholas is the author of two influential books and their first book, \u201cQueer Post-Gender Ethics,\u201d published by Palgrave McMillan in 2014, explores the intersections of gender, sexuality, and ethics. Their second book, \u201cThe Persistence of Global Masculinism,\u201d co-authored with Chris Agius, was published in 2018, shedding light on the complex dynamics of masculinity in a global context. Lucy is currently working on two streams of research: one on sexuality and gender diversity, and one on men, masculinity, and violence prevention. With their expertise and commitment to advancing knowledge in gender and sexuality studies, Dr Lucy Nicholas continues to make significant contributions to academia and beyond. \"Teasing-Eve\": Sexual Harassment of Women in Dhaka city, Bangladesh in the Era of Rape Culture, Misogyny and Slacktivism - Dr Arunima Kishore Das Over 90% of women who use public transport in Dhaka, Bangladesh, have experienced some form of sexual harassment during their commute. Despite this alarming figure, few studies have explored women's experiences of sexual harassment, the effectiveness of NGO initiatives, and how women are taking action. At Western Sydney University's School of Humanities and Communication Arts, Dr Arunima Kishore Das is trying to change that. By combining qualitative surveys and social media analysis, Dr Das, an Associate Lecturer at Western Sydney University, investigated women's experiences of sexual harassment on public transport, their views on women's rights and gender relations, and how they use social media to raise awareness. \"NGOs tend to portray women in Bangladesh as passive victims,\" says Dr Das. \"But many are using social media campaigns to try and change their situation. This isn't being acknowledged.\" Dr Arunima Kishore Das joined the School of Humanities and Communication Arts as an Associate Lecturer in Culture and Society in April 2023 after completing her PhD in the same discipline. Her PhD project primarily documented the sexual harassment (SH) of women by critically examining women commuters' SH narratives, NGO interventions and women activists' contemporary autonomous digital media initiatives to address sexual harassment on public buses in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Before commencing her PhD, Dr Das completed a Master's degree in Women's and Gender Studies. Her teaching and research interests include critical theorization of race, racism and multiculturalism, gendered space, migration, masculinities, gender-based violence, feminism and digital media campaigns. 'Nothing Really Happened' - Exploring Harassment in the Legal Profession - Dr Ashlee Gore Dr Ashlee Gore is a Lecturer in Criminology at Western Sydney University. Dr Gore's research explores gendered violence with a focus on violence against women and the social, cultural, and legal constructions of responsibility. In this Thought Leadership event Dr Gore will present her research into women's perceptions and/or experiences of sexual harassment in the legal profession, and the role this plays in women's pathways into/out of the legal profession. Sexual harassment of women is rife in the Australian Legal industry. Conservative research estimates suggest one in four women in the legal profession experience sexual harassment. This is rarely reported and is connected to the high attrition rate of women in the law (Law Council of Australia, 2020). This work is based on interviews with Australian women who are current, emerging, and former legal professionals. The women described a continuum of experiences ranging from 'everyday' intrusions to more overt harassment, to extreme experiences of sexual assault by them or others they have witnessed. Cosmographies: Preview Screening plus Q+A with Dr Juan Francisco Salazar Cosmographies is a 93-minute hybrid film that draws from speculative fiction, observational and poetic documentary, Indigenous futurisms, and Indigiqueer approaches to weave together cosmic stories about the struggle for environmental justice against ongoing forms of extractivism and ecological ruin in the Atacama Desert as an allegory against ongoing plans to colonize the Moon and Mars, where M\u0101ori astrobiologist Xu\u00ea Noon finds solace in 2051. Directed by Juan Salazar in collaboration with performance artist Victoria Hunt and the Lickanantay community of Toconao , Chile, the film is an output of an ARC Future Fellowship grant (2020-2024) and a sequel to Salazar's earlier film Nightfall on Gaia (2015). Juan Francisco Salazar is a Chilean interdisciplinary researcher, author and documentary filmmaker whose academic and creative work explore the coupled dynamics of social-ecological change and is underpinned by a collaborative ethos across the arts, sciences and activism. He is a Professor of Communication and Media in the School of Humanities and Communication Arts and a member of the Institute for Culture and Society (ICS). Please note: This preview screening was held for the Western Sydney University community only. 2023 Events From Hot Suburbs to Cool Towns From Hot Suburbs to Cool Towns - Dr Sebastian Pfautsch: 14 February 2023 Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, where nearly 90% of the population lives in towns and metropolitan areas. The trend in Australia and elsewhere in the world is towards larger and denser cities. Both processes, expansion of cities at their fringe zones and densifying within, make cities hotter. This is counterproductive in a time where our summers become hotter. We must do the opposite \u2013 develop urban spaces so they keep cool. Dr Sebastian Pfautsch is an Associate Professor at the Urban Transformations Research Centre of Western Sydney University where he develops strategies to keep cities cool. He is an advocate for change who regularly features in the media. His work has changed government policies and practices and he has won state and national awards for his projects. In this talk, he explained why it is necessary to pivot urban design and development from business-as-usual to cool. Using practical examples, he demonstrated the wide range of possibilities available today to create heat-smart towns and cities for tomorrow \u2013 from simple changes around residential homes to turning public parks into large air conditioners. You may find out about his work on car parks , playgrounds and schools as well. This presentation was recorded, and is available to watch . Life after school for young people with intellectual disabilities Life after school for young people with intellectual disabilities - Dr Lise Mogensen: 28 February 2023 Dr Lise Mogensen is an Associate Professor at School of Medicine Western Sydney University, with demonstrated teaching excellence in project based learning. Lise\u2019s areas of expertise include Research Design and Supervision, Lecturing, Medical Education, Medical Sociology, Childhood and Disability Studies.

Learn how they got into science, their current research, what challenges they have faced as females in the scientific community and celebrate the rise of women in the industry. Proudly bought to you by Western Sydney University Library, Science @ The Local and Penrith City Library What did Australia learn about Country after the 2019-2020 catastrophic bushfires? What did Australia learn about Country after the 2019-2020 catastrophic bushfires? - Dr Jessica Weir: 14 March 2023 Associate Professor Jessica Weir discusses what Australia learnt about Country in response to the catastrophic bushfires of 2019-20 and invites discussion from the audience. What did Australia learn about Country after the 2019-20 catastrophic bushfires? Australia\u2019s 2019-20 catastrophic bushfires were shocking \u2013 the long stretch of burnt out eastern-seaboard localities, the capital cities blanketed in smoke, and particles from this continent circling the globe. There was national and international media interest in Indigenous peoples\u2019 burning practices as \u2018the answer\u2019. This media attention reflects generational shifts by non-Indigenous individuals and institutions towards more respectful relations with Indigenous peoples (e.g. Welcome to Country ceremonies ). However, understanding whether Indigenous fire management is the answer requires understanding first what is the question ; and this, as Indigenous leaders keep reiterating, requires understanding Country. This presentation considers what the catastrophic bushfire inquiries tell us about where the Federation of Australia is at with learning about Country. Associate Professor Weir will demonstrate how diverging and aligning Indigenous and non-Indigenous bushfire expertise offers not just more possibilities for responding to global environmental crisis, but more possibilities for understanding expert knowledge itself. Associate Professor Weir: 'I contribute as a white non-Indigenous scholar descended from colonialists, and my scholarship is both charged and constrained by this positionality.' Gender Matters Gender Matters - Professor Susanne Gannon: 19 April 2023 How and in what ways does gender matter in Australian education? How are pedagogies, practices and policies influenced by understandings of gender? What old ideas and approaches persist and how do these need to change for the present? How are young people, teachers and school leaders responding to contemporary notions of gender? How has feminist thinking and praxis been effective in the in the past and what is needed now? In this presentation, Professor Susanne Gannon revisits her work in this field over more than twenty years, in the school education and university sectors, to consider what does it mean now for schools to be inclusive, safe spaces for all students of all genders to thrive. In particular her work considers initiatives in secondary schools, and the findings from the ARC funded Gender Matters project (with Prof Kerry Robinson). Wombats: Creatures of Wonder Wombats: Creatures of Wonder - Associate Professor Julie Old: 19 April 2023 The Growing Thought Leadership series aims to promote and celebrate Western Sydney University's work aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for a younger audience.

Presented by Western Sydney University\u2019s Associate Professor Julie Old, Ecologist and Western Sydney University Library. Either Lost or Found? A Child\u2019s Story from a WWII Australian Internment Camp Either Lost or Found? A Child\u2019s Story from a WWII Australian Internment Camp - Professor Pedram Khosronejad and Mrs Helga (Girschik) Griffin: 1 June 2023 As many as 50,000 German, Italian, and Japanese civilians were sent to Internment camps in Australia during WWII. Until today, the lives and fates of 512 German civilians of Persia (Iran), the imprisoned inhabitants of Australian World War II confinement centres, and the roles that they and their family members played in the development of post-war Australia has been ignored by academia. Professor Pedram Khosronejad and Mrs Helga (Girschik) Griffin present the findings of a research project which explores the socio-cultural history and memories of a group of civilian German detainees and migrants in Australia through their heritage and the roles that they played in the development of the country after World War II. This presentation is the result of a four year collaboration between Professor Khosronejad and Mrs Helga (Girschik) Griffin, the only surviving female among the civilian Germans from Persia (Iran) who were brought to Australia as families and allegedly kept in detention, but actually lived like prisoners in Tatura\u2019s Internment Camp No. 3 (1941-46). The daughter of an Austrian railway engineer working in Iran (1936-41), Helga was aged six when, with her parents and younger brother, she became a captive of the British Army\u2019s invasion of that politically neutral country in 1941. Her family was evicted from Iran and sent by sea to a WWII prison camp at a secret destination. Her family\u2019s internment in Australia\u2019s Camp 3, Tatura, in north-western Victoria, lasted five years. Helga\u2019s story represents a rare opportunity to hear a first-hand account of a young female\u2019s experiences arriving in Australia by boat as a stateless refugee and being placed in detention for an unforeseeable time. She is the only surviving female from 512 civilian Germans detained in Iran who were taken into Australian WWII internment prison camps. The research project investigates whether the concept of internment is a polite euphemism to disguise the political actuality of civilians being treated like prisoners without any political or moral conviction. Helga\u2019s so-called internment was associated with life threatening danger during transportation, long-term detention in an antagonistic political environment, and the fracture of a child\u2019s normal development. It is questionable whether such violations of Human Rights are excusable in the interest of a foreign neutral country\u2019s national security during a time of war. This event also includes an exhibition curated by Professor Pedram Khosronejad displaying some of the objects from Mrs Griffin\u2019s family collection from their internment periods in Tatura Internment prison camp. After the event, Mrs Helga (Girschik) Griffin will be signing copies of her book \"At Home in Exile\", which will be available to purchase for $44. Please bring exact change. Girschik Collection.

Time: 12 noon to 1pm Location: Penrith City Council Redrawing the Circular Economy : Organic waste and Peri-urban futures Redrawing the Circular Economy : Organic waste and Peri-urban futures - Dr Stephen Healyeading: 25 July 2023 This talk presents the findings of an Australian Research Council Discovery project called \"Innovative Waste Economies: Redrawing the Circular Economy\". The circular economy is a policy response to the global waste crisis, aiming to replace the \"take-make-waste\" economy with a more sustainable model that prolongs product life, reduces waste, and recovers the value of discarded materials. However, achieving circularity requires more than just technical improvements in waste management - it also involves reconfiguring social practices, economic relationships, and ingrained habits. Our research centres social-practices of experimentation with waste already underway in Australia that are attempting to renegotiate how we live with waste. In this talk, we discuss one such experiment that involves a range of stakeholders working together to organize the reverse logistics of transporting organic waste (specifically, spent coffee grounds) from Sydney city cafes, businesses, and universities to peri-urban farms practicing regenerative farming. Our research aims to explore the social and economic relationships required to make this type of circularity work. The City of Sydney has set the ambitious goal of an 80% reduction of organic waste from landfill by 2030. Meeting this ambitious goal involves rapid and ambitious transformation. What emerges from our research is a more inclusive and participatory vision of circularity, which aims to achieve a wider range of goals beyond simply waste reduction.

Workforce and Training Issues in the Disability Sector Workforce and Training Issues in the Disability Sector - Dr Caroline Mills: 31 August 2023 Public Thought Leadership Event In-Person / Online There are 4.4 million people living with disability in Australia. That\u2019s 1 in 6 people. The likelihood of disability increases with increasing age. People with disability experience more disadvantage when it comes to participation and employment. This presentation discusses the work of Western Sydney University and the Western Sydney Disability Hub with a focus on two key workforce issues. First, there are not enough workers to meet demand within the disability sector. This is putting a strain on existing services and staff, compromising participation and outcomes for people with disability who want to access therapies and supports in the daily life. Second, people with disability are less likely to be employed. This can cause a cycle of poverty and welfare dependency negatively impacting on outcomes for people with disability. Come and hear from industry professionals and lived experience to see how this issue may be addressed. Dr Caroline Mills is an occupational therapist and academic in the School of Health Sciences at Western Sydney University. Her work focuses on health and disability and is often co-designed with industry stakeholders and those with lived experience. Kitty Mach is a provisional psychologist and WSU alumni, with lived experience of autism and ADHD. She brings a unique perspective to her work in the disability sector. Jeff Scobie is a recognised leader in the disability field with over 40 years experience in the disability sector in various roles. He is currently the CEO of Macarthur Disability Services.

Rethinking Approaches to Achieving Sustainable Development Goals In An Era Of Smart Computing Rethinking Approaches to Achieving Sustainable Development Goals In An Era Of Smart Computing - Professor Athula Ginige, Dr Bahman Javadi Jahantigh and Dr Ashini Wesumperuma: 7 September Food security is essential for the survival of humankind and is linked to many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Each SDG has some connection to other SDGs creating a complex web of interconnected systems. At a fundamental level, these interconnections facilitate the exchange of knowledge, material, services, and money. Smart Computing can facilitate these exchanges to significantly enhance economic, social, and environmental outcomes. In this seminar, we will show practical applications of Smart Computing to achieve food security by creating Digital Agrifood Ecosystems. Unlike traditional digital agriculture, digital agrifood ecosystems take a holistic approach by integrating various stakeholders in the food system, including farmers, consumers, supply chains, agriculture extension and other service providers, and policymakers. It enhances the flow of information among these stakeholders, enabling them to coordinate activities leading to improved productivity, distribution, quality, and food availability, focusing on achieving food security. These ecosystems leverage advances in digital technologies, social computing, inferencing, predictive, and generative computational techniques to create necessary information flows to facilitate the timely and context-specific exchange of knowledge, material (inputs and harvest), and money. We will present some case studies of application of these innovations in agriculture practices in Sri Lanka, India, and Africa. Professor Athula Ginige holds a B.Sc. first-class honours in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. He completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge on a Cambridge Commonwealth Scholarship.

Teaching for Sustainability Teaching for Sustainability - Professor Graciela Metternicht: 25th October 2023 Why should we aim to empower our students to work and think globally, implementing strategies to end poverty, improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth \u2013 all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests? This year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a synthesis report summarising the state of knowledge of climate change, its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. The message is clear: the windows of opportunity for climate resilient development are narrowing and education has a role to play towards creating a more informed society in terms of consumption and lifestyle. This presentation will touch on specific points of the IPCC Report relating to the understanding of causality and impact, and how this can inform and educate responses focused on adaptation to climate change. Join us to hear Professor Graciela Metternicht discuss the importance of learning design to teach sustainable development, and why and how we can meaningfully teach skills students can apply in their future professions, making a tangible difference to our world. Graciela Metternicht is the Dean of Science at Western Sydney University. She is a Professor of Geography with over 25 years of experience in environmental management, sustainability and the science-policy interface. Her research interests are primarily in environmental geography, with a focus on geospatial technologies and their application in environmental management and policy (sustainable land management, terrestrial ecosystems) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

She is also an Adjunct Professor of Environmental Geography at the Earth and Sustainability Science Research Centre, UNSW Sydney. Date & time: Wednesday 25th October 2023, 12:00pm-1:00pm Location: Western Sydney University, Parramatta City Campus, Peter Shergold Building, Level 9, Conference room 2 (PC-01.9.16) or Online via Zoom. Fix My Food: Sustainable Food Systems Fix My Food: Sustainable Food Systems - Dr Catharine Fleming: 8 November 2023 Global food systems are failing children and adolescents. Poor diet quality is driving malnutrition among adolescents around the world. The quality of food eaten by adolescents not only determines their health and development but is also the foundation of thriving communities. With 1.3 billion adolescents (10-19 years), forming 16 percent of the world\u2019s population (UNICEF Data 2023), investment in the transition from childhood to adulthood during this critical period of growth is crucial. To develop a truly child-centred food system, we need to understand how children navigate their food environments, deciding what to eat, where to eat, and where to buy it. To do this we used a novel distributed data generation method to consult with 1,300 children and adolescents from over 30 countries to document their needs, experiences and aspirations in relation to nutrition, food environments and food systems. We published two companion reports to UNICEF\u2019s State of the World\u2019s Children 2019 report and a seminal report on how young people engage with their food systems globally. This presentation will showcase what young people told us about a range of barriers which impact their ability to consume foods that are healthy, nutritious, and sustainable. We will also highlight how children and young people want to be engaged in the food system transformation. Join us to hear recommendations from children and adolescents across the world and what they identified as urgent actions needed to transform food systems and reduce the negative impact on young people and their environment. Dr Catharine Fleming is a Lecturer in Public Health in the School Health Science, Western Sydney University and is Stream Co-Lead for Youth Participation and Engagement in the Young and Resilient Research Centre. Dr Fleming has a PhD in paediatric nutrition and dietetics and over 15 years\u2019 experience in paediatric nutrition relating to infant and young child feeding, paediatric food allergy and childhood obesity. Dr Fleming has research experience in mixed methods, co design, clinical and public health research methodologies covering quantitative, qualitative and data linkage studies. This experience has involved working with families, children and population-based data in paediatric nutrition in a variety of clinical, community and global settings. Dr Fleming is building a body of work focusing on protecting against lifelong chronic disease through investigating different aspects of feeding and diet in the most teachable moments of childhood and adolescence. Dr Fleming is passionate about ensuring a sustainable nutritional change occurs for children and adolescents through co-designed and development of interventions and policies by young people for young people.

In Indigenous society, knowledge is passed from generation to generation in an oral tradition. As a child, Auntie Fran Bodkin\u2019s mother took her around Dharawal country showing her the native plants and teaching her their medicinal uses. After her mother\u2019s death when she was 14 years old, Auntie Fran committed to carrying on with this work and eventually went to university, where she studied environmental science. Auntie Fran has recorded the knowledge she has accumulated about native plants found in Dharawal Country in the Dharawal Pharmacopeia to ensure that this knowledge is recognised and respected by western science and protected under western law. Auntie Fran gifted the Dharawal Pharmacopeia to Western Sydney University (whose Campbelltown campus is located on Dharawal country) for the purposes of research, education, and community engagement, and in particular, so that students of Western Sydney University can learn about the plants and their medicinal uses. The Dharawal Pharmacopeia is a single digital work. Access to material from the Dharawal Pharmacopeia is by default restricted to Western Sydney University staff and students. Use of the content in the Pharmacopeia is governed by strict Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP) guidelines. Dealing with any part of the traditional knowledge incorporated in the Dharawal Pharmacopoeia for publications and commercial exploitation that has not been authorised by Auntie Frances (Fran) Bodkin and the Dharawal people is a serious breach of the customary laws of the Indigenous community and may also breach the Copyright Act 1968. For more information please contact copyright@westernsydney.edu.au Access to researchers beyond WSU is approved by Auntie Fran on a case-by-case basis. Request access to the Dharawal Pharmacopeia .

          "text": " OpenAthens: A new way to access e-Resources Home Collections OpenAthens: A new way to access e-Resources The Library is transitioning to a new mechanism for authentication to online library resources. OpenAthens is an authentication tool that provides secure and flexible access to licensed online resources via single sign-on (SSO) technology. It is replacing EZProxy. OpenAthens enables access to Library subscriptions directly from most large publisher websites as well as via links from the Library website, Library Search and your A-Z Resources. Check back to this page for project updates. Timeline/Schedule How can I help? To ensure a smooth transition, we are seeking volunteers to help test OpenAthens. While extensive internal testing has been conducted, we value your input in identifying any remaining issues. To register your interest, please enter your email address in this form . The library will provide you with a testers package in early February. FAQs What is OpenAthens? OpenAthens is a type of federated SAML Single Sign-On (SSO). SSO allows end users to access subscribed products and services using their existing institutional credentials. SSO is widely considered to be a best practice for digital access, due to its exceptional security and the control it gives your institution over data sharing. Why did we change authentication services? OpenAthens replaces our previous authentication service, Ezproxy, as it offers a more secure, reliable and flexible service reducing frustrations with multiple logins. How do I use OpenAthens? Using any of the Library's discovery tools will automatically invoke OpenAthens - e.g. Readings, Library Guides and the A-Z of e-resources. But if you locate a resource using another discovery tool and you see a 'Sign in via institution' or 'Sign in via OpenAthens' option on a web site you will see a OpenAthens option appear if we have a subscription to something on the platform. Will signing in to library resources be any different? In most cases, no. What happens to my bookshelf or personal accounts on publisher sites? If you have set up personal accounts in library e-Resources, most of them won't need any action from you. However, the following ones will require you to do something to move your saved items over: Proquest eBook Central When you use eBook Central for the first time via OpenAthens, a new user account will be created. If you have previously created an eBook Central account and want to move over the items on your bookshelf to your new user account please let us know via this form and we will request your account be merged. We will need to know: Your previous eBook Central username Your new eBook Central username EBSCOhost New and returning users signing in via OpenAthens authentication for the first time will have a new Personal Folder created on EBSCOhost. You are able to merge your previous account to your new account using these instructions from EBSCO once OpenAthens is live from February 18. How do I change my links? Links can be changed by copying your EZProxy link/bookmark into our custom link generator Contact Us "

New books are added to this collection annually, showcasing a range of subjects including historical accounts, biographies, popular Australian culture, periodic lifestyle pieces, indigenous works and fiction.

Scrublands is an engaging and atmospheric crime drama about a journalist who travels to an Australian country town, Riversend, one year after a terrible tragedy. Riversend\u2019s young and charismatic priest, on a seemingly normal Sunday, suddenly opens fire on and kills five parishioners before being shot dead himself. Martin Scarsden, troubled by his own past, is there to write a feature on the anniversary of the shooting. Martin soon discovers that the town has dark secrets that powerful forces are determined to keep buried. This is a multilayered mystery, full of complex and interconnected characters. The plot threads are tightly plotted and woven together \u2013 Chris Hammer\u2019s skills as a former journalist are evident here. The environment in its stifling desert heat is a character in its own right! And Martin, what a fantastic character \u2013 an imperfect, damaged man but still so determined. I really liked him. A well-paced and interesting novel! The audiobook read by Dorje Swallow is excellent, as is the miniseries starring Jay Ryan and Luke Arnold. Australian rural crime at its best. Recommended for fans of mysteries where things aren\u2019t what they seem. Notable quote: \u201cBut then again, the troubled are always young; the old are simply pathetic. Grow old and the edges come off: the mind rationalises, the heart concedes, the soul surrenders. We all grow old and frail, inside as well as out.\u201d Borrow this book Black River by Matthew Spencer Recommended by Suzanne Robinson, Library Client and Collections Officer Yet another strong and viable debut from a new Australian author. This was a page turning and thrilling ride surrounding the murder of a girl on the grounds of an elite boarding school. Black River is a gritty and palpable police procedural, set around the corner from where I grew up in Western Sydney. Full of all the usual Aussie colloquialisms, the book has down to earth writing matched well with an interesting and unique storyline. Suburbs from Breakfast Point, to St Marys, Mt Druitt, Toongabbie, Pemulwuy, Blayney and Orange are mentioned, so for Sydney siders and those living in the west this adds an extra layer. The vibrant Parramatta River ties this all together with wonderfully evocative, well-drawn and likeable characters, this is a series to keep an eye on. Borrow this book Interesting facts "

          "text": "Evaluating Sources Home Researchers Conducting Research Evaluating Sources Each resource requires evaluation to determine its authority and appropriateness for your research. Once you've developed and run a good search strategy, you will need to thoroughly evaluate the information you've found. Some information sources will be more appropriate and reliable than others, so this evaluation is very important. All information should be evaluated according to the following criteria: Reliability of the source The quality of information may vary according to the reliability of its source and therefore you must consider: Is the source scholarly and/or peer-reviewed? Validity Does the focus of the work match your needs? Is the focus scholarly or popular? Popular magazines such as Time can contain useful information, but it must be verifiable by another source. Is the work a primary source (data, diaries, original documents etc.), a secondary source (evaluation of previously published material) or a tertiary source (encyclopedia, dictionary etc.)? Each type can be appropriate for Authority. When was the resource published? Older material is suitable for establishing a historical context but not for information on current issues. Website specific: When was the site last updated and by whom? Avoid using undated websites. Authority Who is the author or editor? Are their qualifications, experience, institutional affiliation, and other publications listed? Can the author be contacted for clarification? Website specific: Who created the website? Are adequate contact details and/or provenance available for the creator? An email address is not sufficient. Bias Is the purpose of the writing clearly stated? Is it technical or clinical? Who is the intended audience? Is the language free of emotion and bias? Is the material factual, opinion or propaganda? Relevancy Is the information peer reviewed? Is there supporting evidence for assertions made? Is the information verifiable? Is there an accurate bibliography? How does the work relate to material you have already read? Does it update, substantiate, or add new information? Explore a variety of opinions. Are the ideas and arguments similar to other readings on the same topic? Is the text well written and presented? You should also be aware of fake news, false or misleading information presented as news. You can learn to spot fake news online with these free tools for fact-checking bogus stories , or look into Why Do Our Brains Love Fake News?

          "text": " Literature Reviews Home Researchers Conducting Research Literature Reviews What is a literature review? A literature review is a critical summary and analysis of current scholarship on a topic. The material may be empirical, theoretical, critical, analytical, or methodological in nature and the literature may include multimedia and web-based material along with the more traditional book, report and journal article formats. Why is a literature review important? Literature reviews are important because they: Build knowledge and identify research methodologies and seminal works in your field. Help focus and refine your research question by articulating the knowledge gap. Provide the intellectual context for your work and situate it within the field. Ensure you will not be replicating existing knowledge or reproducing technical errors. Identify other researchers in your field. Identify the distinctive contribution your research will make and to produce a rationale and justification for your study. Show how research findings are discussed and presented in your discipline area. For each resource, ask these questions: Has the author clearly defined the problem/issue and has its significance been clearly established? Could the problem or topic have been approached more effectively from another perspective? What is the author's research orientation and theoretical framework? In a research study how sound are the basic components of the study designed? How accurate and valid are the measurements? Is the analysis of the data accurate and are the conclusions valid and logical? Who is the intended audience of the material? Is there an objective basis to the reasoning or is the author merely trying to prove their already held beliefs? How does the author structure the argument? In what ways does the item contribute to your understanding of the problem? What are the strengths and limitations? How does the item specifically relate to the research you are about to undertake? Conducting literature reviews How you approach doing a literature review, whether you need to write a literature review or conduct a systematic review , will be dictated by the type of research you are doing. Whichever method you use, when it comes to literature review writing, you need to think about several things: The purpose of the review. Where it will be placed in the thesis. What the scope and focus of the literature review will be. Planning and writing the literature review There are several steps to developing a literature review and they are not necessarily sequential. Identify: Formulate your research question to help frame and direct your reading. Compile a list of references and determine the most appropriate system with which to file them, see managing your references using EndNote . Document: Keep a record of literature relating to your topic and make sure you can retrieve it again if necessary. Note why you have chosen each piece while it is fresh in your memory. Ensure Relevance: Prioritise the literature you have identified and note its importance. Screen literature before downloading or printing to avoid being overwhelmed by volume of material retrieved. Retrieve: Make copies of the most important literature first. Revise: When taking notes ensure you reference articles accurately so you will be able to cite them if necessary. Plan: Having a sense of the overall review will make it easier to write. It can be useful to draw diagrams of how the literature fits together to provide you with the big picture. Begin Writing: Start with an introduction that details what you intend to cover, how it will be organised and boundaries such as what is outside scope. Then discuss the literature in a logical and coherent way, concluding with a paragraph that relates to your research project. Abide by the academic conventions of your subject field. Obtaining resources You may request purchase of resources not held by the Library, or obtain them through a Document Delivery request . If you need further assistance, Library Study Smart can help, or you may request a research consultation with your School Librarian.

          "text": " Types of Research Methods Home Researchers Conducting Research Types of Research Methods Different types of research methods - the strategies, processes or techniques used in collecting data or evidence for analysis - help you create better understanding of your research topic, and new knowledge. The different types of research methods use different tools and approaches. For further assistance, consult with your School Librarian. Qualitative research What is qualitative research? Qualitative research gathers data about lived experiences, emotions or behaviours, and the meanings individuals attach to them. It assists in enabling researchers to gain a better understanding of complex concepts, social interactions or cultural phenomena. This type of research is useful in the exploration of how or why things have occurred, interpreting events and describing actions. When searching for qualitative research it is important that you search across a range of databases, as no single database covers all the literature. The decision regarding which databases to search depends largely upon your research topic. Journal databases also provide search hints and tips in the help menu - start there if you are not familiar with the database. Developing a robust search strategy will help reduce irrelevant results. It is good practice to plan a strategy before you start to search. Basic search tips: Break your research topic into keywords. Use Boolean operators to connect your search terms or keywords together to either narrow or broaden the results. The three basic Boolean operators are: AND, OR, and NOT. Use parentheses, quotation marks, and/or asterisks with your search terms to create a search phrase. Subject terms: Databases categorise their records using subject terms or controlled vocabularies (also called thesauri). These subject terms vary for each database. For example you can find qualitative research in MEDLINE by using the subject terms 'Qualitative Research' or 'Nursing Methodology Research', but in CINAHL , use the term 'Qualitative Studies'. Related subject terms such as 'Focus Groups', 'Interviews', or 'Descriptive Research' can also be useful. Combine searches with subject terms to locate qualitative research. Keywords: Use selective free text keywords to search in titles, abstracts or records held in the databases to identify qualitative research. Selective keywords include terms like phenomenological , \"lived experience\" , \"grounded theory\" , \"life experiences\" , \"focus groups\" or interview . Limiting searches: Databases enable sets of results to be limited or filtered by specific fields. You can filter by using such criteria as Publication Type, Clinical Queries or Publication Year and apply them to your search. Quantitative research What is quantitative research? Quantitative research gathers numerical data which can be ranked, measured, or categorised through statistical analysis. It assists with uncovering patterns or relationships, and for making generalisations. This type of research is useful for finding out how many, how much, how often or to what extent. When searching for quantitative research it is important that you search across a range of databases, as no single database covers all the literature. The decision regarding which databases to search depends upon your research topic. Journal databases also provide search hints and tips in the help menu - start there if you are not familiar with the database. Developing a robust search strategy will help reduce irrelevant results. It is good practice to plan a strategy before you start to search. Basic search tips: Break your research topic into keywords. Use Boolean operators to connect your search terms or keywords together to either narrow or broaden the results. The three basic Boolean operators are: AND, OR, and NOT. Use parentheses, quotation marks, and/or asterisks with your search terms to create a search phrase. Subject terms: Databases categorise their records using subject terms or controlled vocabularies (also called thesauri). These subject terms vary for each database For example, quantitative research is not directly indexed in PubMed but can be located by using subject terms including: 'Validation Studies as Topic', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Mathematical Concepts', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic' 'Investigative Techniques' or 'Meta-Analysis as Topic'. Combine searches with subject terms to locate quantitative research. Keywords: Use selective free text keywords to search in titles, abstracts or records held in the databases to identify quantitative research. Selective keywords include quantitative , survey , validity , variance , correlation and statistical . Mixed methods research What is mixed methods research? Mixed methods research integrates both qualitative and quantitative research. It provides a holistic approach combining and analysing statistical data with deeper contextualised insights. Using mixed methods also enables triangulation, or verification, of the data from two or more sources. Examples of finding mixed methods research in the databases: In MEDLINE , there are no suitable Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for mixed methods research, but you can search your topic with the following suggested keywords using the quotation marks and truncation symbol (*): \u201cmixed model*\u201d OR \u201cmixed design*\u201d OR \u201cmultiple method*\u201d OR multimethod* OR triangulat* In CINAHL , use the following subject terms: 'Multimethod Studies' or 'Triangulation'. You can also include the following keywords: mixed model*, mixed design*, multiple method*, multimethod*, or triangulat*.

It informs ethics approval and considers how much data is expected, what type of data formats are used, who needs access to it and how the value of it can be maximised for future reuse. At the completion of your project, you can submit your dataset to be discoverable in the Research Data Australia portal. A Research Data Management Plan must be developed at the beginning of every research project . Intersect Online Training: Introduction to Research Data Management at Western Sydney - This two-hour workshop is ideal for researchers who want to know how to create a research data management plan. Check the Research Events calendar for upcoming sessions. Read more about Research Data Management planning . What is research data? Research data are all of the evidence that informs or supports your research findings. They can be qualitative or quantitative materials including interviews, observations, video/audio recordings, measurements, simulations, statistics, instrument readings and numerical data. Your data are your most valuable asset as a researcher. You need a plan to manage your data across the whole research data life-cycle. Maintaining comprehensive data, materials and records for each research project or activity is essential to the integrity of research. Sensitive Data Sensitive data are often confidential as they can be used to identify an individual, species, object, process, or location. This information could introduce a risk of discrimination, harm, or unwanted attention for an individual. It can include personal and health/medical data, Indigenous data, ecological data, or commercial-in-confidence data. Sensitive data are commonly subject to legal and ethical obligations that impose restrictions on how they are accessed, used, and handled. The data often can\u2019t simply be published and made openly accessible. Read more about sensitive data . Finding and reusing research data Secondary analysis of existing data is common practice in many academic fields. Existing data can be used to conduct new research, test hypotheses or replicate findings from previous studies. Using existing data can improve efficiency and reduce costs in the data collection process, reduce participant fatigue, and reduce duplication of efforts. Discover research data using open access subject-specific and general data repositories. Research data storage Western Sydney University offers storage for all active research projects' working data; and storage for archival data at the completion of the project. Read more about storage for research data . Publishing research data Publishing research data is a key step in the scholarly publishing process because it promotes transparency, reproducibility, and the validation of research methods. Research data are primary research outputs that can be openly published to Research Data Australia for maximum discoverability and reuse. Sensitive or private data can be shared with restricted access so that you can consider requests for your data against your criteria. To publish a research dataset, use the Research Data Management Planning dashboard to follow these steps: Create a Research Data Management Plan - All researchers and HDR candidates must develop a research data management plan at the beginning of their research project to ensure a robust data management framework is in place prior to starting research at the University. It can begin as a basic plan and further information can be added as the project progresses Archive - A descriptive record will be retained in the Library's repository for long-term access and archiving. The Library works with ITDS to create secure long-term storage for archived datasets, taking into consideration privacy and access conditions associated with the data Publish - The library can publish a description of your data either completely open access, conditional or restricted access. If appropriate, a DOI (permanent identifier) is issued so the dataset can be cited and added to a researcher's ORCID profile. In cases of sensitive data, a metadata-only record can be published that will direct future users back to the original researcher for information on the data.

Licensing datasets for reuse Sensitive data can be shared via Western Sydney University\u2019s Research Profiles and Repository to Research Data Australia with conditional or restricted access that is mediated by the project\u2019s chief investigator. Licensing open-access outputs gives you greater control over how they can be reused. One of the essential ingredients of reusable data is clarity of reuse permissions, terms, and conditions. Prospective users need to know exactly what they can do with the data. Those conditions and permissions need to be explicit. Within the Australian context, this information about the permissions and conditions of reuse can be expressed in different kinds of notices, licences, contracts, etc accompanying the data. Not being clear about permission to reuse data can have the same result as forbidding data reuse, because uncertainty can be enough to discourage the potential user. Creative Commons licences There are six creative commons licenses for use when licensing a dataset for reuse. The best way to decide which is appropriate for you is to think about why you want to share your work, and how you hope others will use that work. It is important to check the conditions or Creative Commons licences that have been applied to any third party datasets that you have used in your research. For help, try the Creative Commons License Chooser . The Creative Commons licence options There are six different licence types, listed from most to least permissive here: CC BY - Use with attribution CC-BY - This licence allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator.

Before you start, check for established procedures within your team or department. One best practice is to structure folders hierarchically and be consistent with names. Use names that describe the file's contents, selecting 3-4 key pieces of information such as project number, team name, facility ID, date or version number. Tidy data principles Tidy data is a standard way to organise data, making it easier to analyse and visualise. It follows three core principles: Each variable forms a column - ensuring that all values for a specific attribute are grouped together. Each observation forms a row - making it easier to track and analyse individual data points. Each value has its own cell - avoiding the issues associated with merged cells or multiple values in a single cell. File versioning To ensure clarity and consistency when managing files, follow these best practices for file versioning: Keep a copy of the raw data in its original format. Make a working copy and save new versions. Include a version number at the end of the file name such as v01. Change this version number each time the file is saved. For the final version, substitute the word FINAL for the version number. This is especially important if files are being shared. Turn on file versioning in OneDrive . Using external digital resources for data analysis As per the Digital Services Implementation Policy , all acquisitions of digital services (free, purchased or downloaded) for research projects are required to complete a Risk and Compliance Determination (RCD) (login to IT portal required) form prior to its installation and / access. This allows the IT team to evaluate IT risks and compliance issues associated with the software and develop recommendations on how any identified risks can be addressed. This includes the use of Artificial Intelligence tools for data collection and analysis. Excel for data analysis These resources are available to learn data analysis with Excel. Microsoft Analyse data in Excel - This resource introduces the Analyze Data functionality that is available to Microsoft Office 365 users. Excel for researchers training - This one-day course is conducted regularly by WSU partner Intersect.

All research data needs to be actively managed so that high-quality data is produced for maximum reusability. Well-managed and described research data: are easy to discover, understand and reuse maximise the efficiency and integrity of your research can increase the impact of research increase a researcher\u2019s visibility and profile make research more reproducible reinforce research findings ensure compliance with funder mandates satisfy publishing conditions. A Research Data Management Plan must be developed at the beginning of every research project . It may also be necessary to include information about data management planning in a funding application. Data management planning A research data management plan is a live document that should be created in the early stages of a research project. It will inform ethics applications, computing and storage requirements, and the long-term usability of the data collected for the project. Consideration of how much and what type of data, who needs access to it, and plans for future reuse by the same team or new researchers, will lay the foundation for efficient data practices throughout the life of the project. A research data management plan should record: why the data was collected, the title, description and associated grant numbers and ethics approvals what the data are about including file format guidance, data organisation, equipment used and naming conventions who was involved and what are their responsibilities when the project is expected to be complete, when the data should be reviewed for disposal or embargoed for publication where the data are stored including data sharing, publishing, archiving and licensing instructions. If you would like further consultation on your technology options, contact the University\u2019s IT Service Desk .

Working storage is where you store the data you are working with on an active research project. Archival storage is where you store the final data from a completed research project. Western Sydney University offers both types of storage. Working storage Working data is collected during an active research project. The University offers online storage options for researchers to use as a secure platform to store and share working data. ( Note: Personal equipment and unsecured hard drives are not recommended as they do not protect data against unauthorised access, alteration, removal, destruction, and accidental or intentional damage.) OneDrive cloud storage - All staff and students have 1TB of storage available on OneDrive. Up to 5 TB is available through the Microsoft Office 365 Online Portal by using your Western Account. University network drives \u2013 Data is secured by Western Account Login credentials and systematically backed up by ITDS. This WFH OneDrive Guide helps you connect to OneDrive for optimal use. Contact the IT Service Desk for assistance with these working data storage solutions, or to enquire about alternative storage options for Research data if these do not meet your needs. Archival storage Final data associated with a research project should be appropriately archived and made available for re-use and citation wherever possible and appropriate. Datasets associated with completed research projects are described and retained by the Library in the Research Profiles and Repository , which are then submitted to the Research Data Australia portal. This increased exposure to Western Sydney University's research output may enable new collaborations and research opportunities. All finalised datasets are archived with a stable URL or DOI (digital object identifier) for citation purposes. A descriptive record will be retained in the Library's repository for long-term access and archiving. The Library works with ITDS to create secure long-term storage for archived datasets, taking into consideration privacy and access conditions associated with the data. Example: Jewell, Paul; Reading, Judy; Kippist, Louise; Donald, Melissa (2017): Interview data from a project investigating information literacy (IL) and employability skills in the workplace for employers and business graduates in greater western Sydney.

To publish a research dataset, use the Research Data Management Planning Dashboard to follow these steps: Create a Research Data Management Plan Create a Research Data Management Plan - All researchers and HDR candidates must develop a research data management plan at the beginning of their research project to ensure a robust data management framework is in place prior to starting research at the University.

If appropriate, a DOI (permanent identifier) is issued so the dataset can be cited and added to a researcher's ORCID profile. In cases of sensitive data, a metadata-only record can be published that will direct future users back to the original researcher for information on the data. Benefits of publishing research data There are many benefits of publishing or sharing research data. Publicly available data records: are associated with an increase in citations promote new opportunities for collaboration improve efficiency and reduce costs reduce research participant fatigue providing credit to the researcher as a research output in its own right benefit the researchers of the future reduce duplication increase a researcher's profile increase the institution's profile satisfy many grant funder's conditions. \"Publicly available data is significantly (p=0.006) associated with a 69% increase in citations , independently of journal impact factor, date of publication, and author country of origin using linear regression.\" Piwowar HA, Day RS, Fridsma DB (2007) Sharing Detailed Research Data Is Associated with Increased Citation Rate. PLoS ONE 2(3): e308. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308 Publishing sensitive data The advantages of publishing your sensitive data will probably far outweigh any potential disadvantages when simple and appropriate steps are taken. Sensitive data can often be anonymised and de-identified so that the value of the data collected can be realised without compromising the privacy of the research participants. Sensitive data that has been de-identified can be shared, but researchers can also place conditions around access to the published data. The library can publish a description of your data which means others can discover it and cite it, without making the data itself openly accessible. This is a metadata-only record that can be issued with a DOI ( permanent identifier) if appropriate and made discoverable through the Research Data Australia portal. Publishing a metadata-only record increases the visibility of your research, which leads to new collaborations, increased citations, and greater research impact. The Australian Research Data Commons provides guidance on when and how to publish sensitive data as openly and ethically as possible . If you need further assistance, the Support for research data management forms are available in WesternNow for both staff researchers and HDR students . Making data FAIR Making Australia\u2019s research data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) supports knowledge discovery and innovation. FAIR provides a useful framework for thinking about sharing data in a way that will enable maximum use and reuse. Findable All published data descriptions are assigned a persistent identifier in the form of a digital object identifier (DOI), and include a preferred citation for inclusion in reference lists. Data descriptions are shared to Research Data Australia , a national discovery portal for research datasets. Accessible FAIR data does not necessarily have to be open access. Data can be restricted due to privacy concerns, national security, or commercial interests. Regardless, a published description should provide clarity and transparency around the conditions governing access and reuse, including a clear machine-readable licence where applicable. Interoperable Using open file formats, unique identifiers and agreed vocabularies in the data and metadata achieves consistency and interoperability between different datasets and the systems that store and use them. Reusable Reusable datasets include rich, contextual description and clear communication of collection parameters, such as instrument calibration, environmental conditions, survey instrument design, software and code used. The Library works with researchers to publish FAIR research datasets and records. Start by creating a Research Data Management Plan for a research project via Research Data Management Planning Dashboard . If you need further assistance, the Support for Research Data Management forms are available in WesternNow for both staff researchers and HDR students . Western Sydney University policy As open as possible, as closed as necessary The products and outputs of research conducted at Western Sydney University (including research data) should be appropriately archived and made openly available for re-use and citation wherever possible. Library staff create a descriptive record to be made available in the Research Data Australia portal. These records are created with a stable URL or DOI (digital object identifier) and direct future researchers\u2019 access enquiries back to the original researcher. Where possible, the data can also be made openly accessible for future use. For further information about storing, archiving and publishing research data, see the WSU Research Data Management Policy . Research funding bodies' requirements Funders of research are increasingly interested in maximising the value of research data and may require you to have a data management plan in place.They may also require the researcher to provide a record of the archived location of the data in an institutional repository such as Western Sydney University\u2019s Research Profiles and Repository. Australia\u2019s two major funding bodies have long recognised the value of proactive data management planning and providing access to research data wherever possible"

It can include personal and health/medical data, Indigenous data, ecological data, or commercial-in-confidence data. Sensitive data is commonly subject to legal and ethical obligations that impose restrictions on how it is accessed, used, and handled. The data often can\u2019t simply be published and made openly accessible. CARE data principles for Indigenous data The emphasis on FAIR data principles creates concern for Indigenous Peoples who are asserting greater control over the use of Indigenous data and Indigenous knowledge for collective benefit. The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance are people and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination. These principles complement the existing FAIR principles encouraging open and other data movements to consider both people and purpose in their advocacy and pursuits. CARE data elements Collective Benefit Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data. Authority to Control Peoples\u2019 rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Indigenous data governance enables Indigenous Peoples and governing bodies to determine how Indigenous Peoples, as well as Indigenous lands, territories, resources, knowledges and geographical indicators, are represented and identified within data. Responsibility Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples\u2019 self-determination and collective benefit. Accountability requires meaningful and openly available evidence of these efforts and the benefits accruing to Indigenous Peoples. Ethics Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem. Read more about data involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples . De-identifying sensitive data De-identified data defines information from which the identifiers about the person have been permanently removed, or where the identifiers have never been included. De-identification is important because it can make research data sources available to future researchers whilst preserving an individual's privacy . Here are some tips to start your de-identification: Plan de-identification early in the research as part of your data management plan. Make sure the consent process includes the accepted level of anonymity required and clearly states what may and may not be recorded, transcribed, or shared. Retain original unedited versions of data for use within the research team and for preservation. Create a de-identification log of all replacements, aggregations or removals made. Store the log separately from the de-identified data files. Identify replacements in text in a meaningful way, e.g. in transcribed interviews indicate replaced text with [brackets] or use XML markup tags, such as <anon>\u2026\u2026</anon>. For qualitative data (such as transcribed interviews or survey textual answers), use pseudonyms or generic descriptors rather than blanking out information. Digitally manipulate audio and image files to remove identifying information. Publishing sensitive data The advantages of publishing your sensitive data will probably outweigh any potential disadvantages when simple and appropriate steps are taken. Sensitive data can often be anonymised and de-identified so that the value of the data collected can be realised without compromising the privacy of the research participants. Sensitive data that has been de-identified can be shared, but researchers can also place conditions around access to the published data. The Library can publish a description of your data which means others can discover it and cite it, without making the data itself openly accessible. This is a metadata-only record that can be issued with a DOI ( permanent identifier) if appropriate and made discoverable through the Research Data Australia portal. Publishing a metadata-only record increases the visibility of your research, which leads to new collaborations, increased citations, and greater research impact. The Australian Research Data Commons provides guidance on when and how to publish sensitive data as openly and ethically as possible .

An International Standard Book Number (ISBN) identifies a book by format (print, audio etc.), edition and publisher. A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is as persistent and stable as an ISBN. The advantage of using a DOI in the online environment is that it can be expressed in resolvable format, (e.g. http://doi.org/10.4225/35/5715bcdd2df24 ) so that there is always a link back to the online location of the item. It is not necessary for an ISBN and DOI to be issued for the same publication unless it will be distributed in both print and electronic formats. To obtain a Western Sydney DOI or ISBN , please read the relevant guidelines and request the appropriate identifier using the form on that page.

For the past three years, alongside a dedicated group of fellow Africans, many from universities across the continent, Western Sydney University academics have spearheaded comprehensive COVID-19 research. Their findings have been published in Q1 open access journals, but despite this accessibility, colleagues in Africa have faced challenges in accessing these vital resources for various reasons ranging from lack of stable internet for download and inexperience in searching databases. Responding to numerous requests for PDF copies, we have worked with Western Sydney University Library to create a solution in the form of an open textbook. To effortlessly download any article at your convenience, Western Sydney University Library has collaborated to ensure these resources are globally accessible through this book. This text supports the five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) listed below. SDG3: Good Health and Well-being: The comprehensive COVID-19 research conducted by the group of Africans and Western Sydney University Academics contributes to understanding and addressing health challenges, aligning with the goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. SDG4: Quality Education: The creation of an open textbook to provide accessible resources addresses the goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. SDG9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure: The efforts to create a solution for accessing research findings through an open textbook align with the goal of building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. SDG10: Reduced Inequality: By ensuring that colleagues in Africa have access to the same resources, regardless of their internet access or experience in searching databases, the initiative contributes to reducing inequalities both within and among countries. SDG17: Partnerships for the Goals: Collaboration between Western Sydney University Academics, the university library, and colleagues in Africa represents the goal of revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development, where stakeholders work together to achieve common objectives.

          "text": "Sports Marketing Home Researchers Western Open Books Sports Marketing By Dr. Jessica Richards Open this book Sports marketing refers to promoting goods and services through sporting events and the endorsement of athletes and sports teams. For any sports organisation, it is imperative to have an effective sports marketing strategy in place to build brand awareness, enhance customer loyalty and generate revenue. Companies in sports use marketing strategies to fulfil their goals, such as attracting more junior players, involving parents, increasing the company's public profile, entertaining spectators, acquiring sponsorships, and securing broadcasting rights deals. This book has been written for sports management students at Western Sydney University for the subject Sports Marketing (BUSM2048) where they will learn general marketing knowledge and theories relevant to the sports industry, such as sponsorship, endorsements, customer experience, pricing and operations.

It is a critical skill. Turnitin is a tool that can help students improve their writing and citation skills. What is Turnitin? Turnitin is a web-based text-matching software that identifies and reports on similarities between documents. While this type of software can be used as a detection tool, it can also, more importantly, be used as an educative tool. It was started over 25 years ago by four University of California students. How does Turnitin work? Students submit assessment papers to Turnitin via their vUWS Subject site. Turnitin compares electronically submitted papers against the following: Student papers worldwide: 1.9+ billion with up to 1 million papers submitted daily, including Western Sydney University student submissions since 2007 Scholarly literature: compared against 190 million+ journal articles in dozens of languages, including open access repositories Internet archive: 91+ billion web pages Your original Turnitin submission is returned with a Similarity Report that highlights text from your paper and links to the original sources. Academics find the Similarity Reports useful as a tool to guide students in following the correct citation practices and to highlight the potential need for greater originality in student work. Note: Turnitin is not used in all subjects at Western Sydney University and may not be utilised for all assignments within a particular subject. Read more about: Submitting a paper The Assignment Dashboard Understanding your Similarity Report Reviewing your grade and instructor feedback See also Turnitin FAQs . For additional student assistance, please contact the Library . For staff assistance, please login to the WesternNow Staff Portal and search for \u2018Turnitin\u2019 knowledge articles.

However, you will find out soon that you may have a hard time mastering it. Stand Up. Start by waving your right hand in front of you left to right. Your palm should be facing away from you while keeping your hand with your fingers pointing up. Now stop that hand and have your left hand in front of you waving it up and down. Now practice moving them at the SAME TIME. Do not move your hands going diagonally. Now switch to have your right hand up and down, and your left hand to right. Do this faster and switch often to make it more difficult. Lastly, to increase the difficulty, have your arms crossed while doing this.

If your School submits Subject Outlines to the CMP via the Curriculum Administration Team , the reading list will be automatically received by the Library after approval. A Readings & Resources List will be created in your subject\u2019s vUWS site. This will contain direct links to the electronic resources themselves or to the Library catalogue for items held in print. If we don\u2019t hold the item we will buy it, with electronic access as a priority as per the Library Collection Development Policy . You should allow 6-8 weeks on average for new items to be received. See the Timeframes below. If your Subject Outline is not submitted via the Learning Guide Management System, please send it to us for processing . Changes to Prescribed or Essential Resources If you require advice around curriculum resources, please contact your School Librarian. They can assist you in selecting resources that minimise costs for students. Any changes to the Subject Outline need to be submitted to the Curriculum Administration Team . We will receive automatic notification of these once approved and update your Readings & Resource List in vUWS. Choosing e-Books for Reading Lists Publishers provide various licensing models for e-books. To help you navigate these options, we've created a guide on Choosing e-Books for Reading Lists , which aims to minimise costs for students around curriculum material. Open Education Resources (OER) Open texts and resources are an excellent option as they offer unlimited user access so lots of people can use them at the same time. They also have the added advantage of a Creative Commons licence that may allow you to tailor their content to best suit your students\u2019 needs. Good places to start are: Pressbooks Directory CAUL OER Collective Catalogue Open access finder tools Western Open Books for WSU publications Reserve Collection Our students value the flexibility of accessing course materials anytime and anywhere. As a multi-campus environment, linking to electronic and digital formats for prescribed and essential texts in Readings & Resources Lists is our priority. Not all course materials are available electronically so each University campus library maintains a limited Reserve Collection. This collection includes physical items, such as books with no digital equivalent. Under exceptional circumstances, personal copies of academic work could be included. Contact your School Librarian to help you identify digital alternatives to print resources. Timeframes "

The Library is here to help you. As a first step, always speak to your School Librarian when you are reviewing your reading list. This saves you time by helping you to clarify which readings can be accessed through the Library. What e-Books are available through the Library for my reading list or the general collection? The Library purchases or subscribes to e-Books which are accessible through the library catalogue from major publishers and platforms, each of which comes with specific user access licences. Publishers may also impose specific Digital Rights Management (DRM) restrictions, which can limit the amount that can be accessed or printed in a single session. The preference is outright purchase, which is DRM free, which guarantees the greatest and permanent access for the collection. Here are some licence types and their impact on student access. It is important to note that publishers determine the licence types and DRM restrictions, not the Library, and not all licence types or DRM settings apply to every eBook title. "

          "text": "Limited user The most common limited e-Book user licence is a 1 or 3 user licence. May be subject to DRM restrictions. These licence types allow the number of users specified to access the e-Book simultaneously. The next user will gain access once someone returns the e-Book, logs off or times out due to inactivity (typically 30 mins). The library will consider buying a few of these for a cohort but it is not possible, within budget, to purchase enough to allow all students to access an e-Book simultaneously. This type of e-Book should be used for general learning only. Avoid assigning these for assessments or exams to limit student frustration and disappointment from receiving a limited-user message . Unlimited user This licence type allows an unlimited number of users to access the e-Book simultaneously. May be subject to DRM restrictions. The library will always purchase this licence when available. These types of e-Books can be used for any purpose and are ideal for general learning and assessments. Open Access (OA) & Open Educational Resource (OER) Open Access or OER e-Books allow an unlimited number of users to access the e-Book simultaneously. These may be hosted through a library database, through DOAB (or other e-Book server) or on their own website. If you find an open e-Book that you would like to use The Library can create a catalogue record that links to its online location both in your reading list and in the Library Search Box. These types of e-Books can be used for any purpose and are ideal for general learning and assessments. Tip: If an Open e-Book has a suitable Creative Commons (CC) licence you may be able to adapt and publish it to perfectly compliment your curriculum through Western Open Books . Contact your School Librarian to discuss possibilities. What e-Book types should I avoid for my reading list or the general collection? There are some e-Books that the Library can\u2019t purchase due to format or licencing restrictions. These e-Book formats are licenced to an individual user and do not permit sharing or lending. If a publisher contacts you about using a specific e-Book for your subject or if you are considering moving to a new textbook, always check with your School Librarian to see what formats or licences are available or suitable for the Library collection. Ensuring that students have access to resources without incurring additional personal costs is important for transition and retention. "
